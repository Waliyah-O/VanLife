a route/url is a portion of our route path that is a placeholder for what will eventually be the actual segment in the url of the page.

NESTING <ROUTE>

		<Route path="vans">
            <Route index element={<Vans />} />
            <Route path=":id" element={<VanDetail />} />
        </Route>

	2. when you want to keep displaying some UI on the page, but also want to display more

1. What is the primary reason to use a nested route?
Whenever we have some shared UI between routes in our app.

2. What is a layout route?
It's the parent route of some nested routes that contains just the portion of the UI that will be shared. It will use an Outlet components

3. What does an <Outlet/> component do and when do you use it?
We use it anytime we have a parent Route that's wrapping children routes. It renders the matching child route's 'element' prop given its route definition.

A layout route will use an outlet component. The outlet component is used anytime we have a parent route that's wrapping children routes. The outlet is a placeholder that represents the place in your parent route where the child routes will render its content 


/************ INDEX ROUTE *************/
what's an index route? 
It's the 'default route' we want to render when the path of the parent route matches. It gives us a chance to render an element inside the parent's <Outlet/> at the same path as the parent route/
